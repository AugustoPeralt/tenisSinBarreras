Dear ATP Tour Development Team,

I am writing to request access to the ATP Tour API for a specialized tennis travel application called **Tennis Travel Assistant**.

## Project Overview

**Application Name:** Tennis Travel Assistant  
**Live Demo:** https://tennis-travel-assistant-km3e7f8if-augusto-peraltas-projects.vercel.app  
**Developer:** Augusto Peralta  
**Contact:** augusperalta@gmail.com  

## Application Purpose

Tennis Travel Assistant is a specialized platform designed to help tennis players, fans, and industry professionals plan optimized travel for ATP tournaments. Our application combines official tournament data with intelligent travel optimization algorithms to provide the best possible travel recommendations.

## Key Features

- **Tournament Calendar Integration**: Display accurate ATP tournament schedules, locations, and details
- **Travel Optimization**: Smart algorithms that match tournament dates with optimal flight and hotel booking opportunities
- **Player-Focused Tools**: Customized planning tools for professional players, coaches, and tennis academies
- **Fan Experience**: Enhanced travel planning for tennis enthusiasts attending tournaments worldwide

## Technical Implementation

- **Architecture**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript, deployed on Vercel
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with optimized tournament data schema
- **Security**: Professional-grade data handling with comprehensive privacy policies
- **Performance**: Optimized for thousands of concurrent users and tournament data

## Data Usage Commitment

We commit to:
- ✅ Using ATP data exclusively for tennis travel planning purposes
- ✅ Proper attribution to ATP Tour as data source
- ✅ Compliance with all API terms and rate limits
- ✅ Secure data handling following industry best practices
- ✅ No redistribution of raw tournament data to third parties

## Business Model

Our application focuses on travel booking commissions and premium features, NOT on selling or redistributing tennis data. ATP tournament information enhances the user experience but is not our revenue source.

## Legal Compliance

- Data attribution and source recognition
- GDPR and international privacy compliance

## Target Audience

1. **Professional Players & Teams**: Season planning and travel optimization
2. **Tennis Fans**: Enhanced tournament attendance experience

4. **Travel Agencies**: Specialized tennis travel services

## Integration Plan

We request access to:
- Tournament schedules and dates
- Venue locations and basic information
- Tournament categories and prize information
- Draw sizes and event types

We understand the importance of official data accuracy for the tennis community and are committed to representing ATP Tour information with the highest level of precision and respect.

## Next Steps

We would welcome the opportunity to:
1. Discuss integration requirements and technical specifications
2. Review our data usage policies and security measures
